Howdy Pardner.

This is just a simple site in the works, basically a 'landing page' for now. 
This was created for an exercise through Dev Bootcamp... the idea is to handcode a site, and
learn Git while we are at it. 

Because yardgno.me is a cool domain name, I will use it for something exiting in the future.

enjoy,
